E-1
X = Quantity in inventory of AN item.
S = Sum of all 'quantity in inventory' items in one store.
Y = store: Sun or Moon.
Percentage of item X in Store Y = X/S

E-2
First, we need to discriminate if it is Sun or Moon Store. Then we discriminate the product, and finally, we sum the number of items.
If Store is Y and if Product is X then Sold is the sum of these quantities.

E-3
By summing the 'Quantity (in units)' rows if the number of the ticket is it the same.

E-4
1. We can also extract the price for each ticket (in the sales table) if we cross-reference the tables.
2. Store Sun and Moon not share ticket numbers (i.e. Sun ticket 1, Moon ticket 2, etc.). This example is a bit unrealistic, normally we found that Sun and Moon, both stores will have ticket 1, ticket 2, etc.
